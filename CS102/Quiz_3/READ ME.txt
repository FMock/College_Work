****This file contains my answers to all 3 quiz questions****
****This is a read file do not try to compile*****
****This folder contain a seperate file for each quiz question for compile****

Question 1.
//Program Description: Part 1 of Quiz 3. This program will open the file
//data.txt for both input and output but first determines if the file exists.
//If the file does not exist, the program will create it and open it for input
//and output.

#include<iostream>
#include<fstream> //Must include this preprocessor directive to use fstream
using namespace std;

int main()
{

    const int SIZE = 200;
    char input[SIZE];
    
    //Create input file stream object
    ifstream inFile("data.txt", ios::in);
    ofstream outFile("data.txt", ios::out|ios::app);
    
    //NOTE TO INSTRUCTOR
    //fstream dataFile("data.txt", ios::in | ios::out);
    //This line did not allow me to read and write so I
    //used seperate file stream objects 

    //Could not open data.txt
    if(!inFile)
    {
        cout << "data.txt did not exist\n";
        cout << "and had to be created\n";
     
        //Write to file
        cout << "Writing to file\n";
        outFile << "Test text on file\n";       
    }
    else
    {

        //File data.txt already exist
        cout << "Writing to file\n";
        outFile << "Test text on file\n";
        //Reading text from file
        cout << "READING TEXT FROM FILE\n";
        cout <<"***********************\n";
        inFile.getline(input, SIZE);
        while(!inFile.eof())
        {
            cout << input << endl;
            inFile.getline(input, SIZE); 
        }

    }

    system("pause");
    return 0;
}

Question 2.
//Program Description: This program will calculate and display the size
//of a file called data.txt which is in the same directory as the program file

#include<iostream>
#include<fstream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    long begin, end;
    
    //Open file stream object  - pointer is at beginning of file
    ifstream DataFile("data.txt");
    //Assign to begin the value returned by member function tellg()
    begin = DataFile.tellg();
    //Move pointer to end of file    
    DataFile.seekg(0, ios::end);
    //Assign to end the value returned by member function tellg()
    end = DataFile.tellg();
    //Calculte and display the number of bytes
    cout << "The file size is " << (end - begin) << " bytes.\n" << endl;
    
    system("pause");
    return 0;
}

Question 3.
//Program Description: This program will rewind the file stream object
//named infoFile after the file has read to the end of the file

#include<iostream>
#include<fstream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    const int SIZE = 200;
    char data[SIZE];
    
    fstream infoFile("data.txt");
    
    infoFile.getline(data, SIZE);
    while(!infoFile.eof())
    {
        cout << data << endl;
        infoFile.getline(data, SIZE); 
    }
    
    //Rewind to the begining of the file
    infoFile.seekg(0, ios::beg);
    
    //Close file stream
    infoFile.close();
    
    system("pause");
    return 0;
}
